    "The food delivery business has experienced significant fluctuations over the past decade. With the rise of technology and the convenience of online ordering, more and more consumers are opting for food delivery services. However, this has also led to increased competition and pressure on companies to offer faster delivery times and lower prices. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the industry, with many restaurants and delivery services pivoting to contactless delivery and takeout options. Overall, the food delivery industry has seen both growth and challenges in the past decade, and it will be interesting to see how it continues to evolve in the future.\n",
